# AST Component Enhancement Experiment (ARCHIVED)

## What This Was
An attempt to use TypeScript AST manipulation to automatically add premium/elite variants to shadcn/ui components at scale.

## Why It Failed
1. **Over-engineered**: Required custom templates for each component type
2. **Not scalable**: Manual work disguised as automation
3. **Limited scope**: Only worked on 4 pre-configured components
4. **Slower than manual**: Template creation took longer than direct edits

## What We Learned
- AST manipulation has high overhead for simple styling tasks
- Mass component transformation needs different approaches
- Component libraries stabilize quickly, reducing need for mass changes
