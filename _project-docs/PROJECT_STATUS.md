# BOISE GUN CLUB V4 - PROJECT STATUS
**Last Updated:** June 26, 2025  
**Deadline:** Monday July 7, 2025 (Board Presentation)  
**Time Remaining:** ~72 hours  

## üéØ PROJECT CONTEXT

**WHO:** Steve Duskett, 36, autistic, recently unmasked, no longer people-pleasing, has serious work ethic now. Runs Innervate Agency. Building this site for FREE for 8 years but getting advertising/portfolio value.

**WHAT:** Complete website rebuild for Boise Gun Club board presentation on Monday July 7th. This is a family-friendly shotgun sports facility (trap, skeet, sporting clays ONLY). Founded 1898, 320 acres, 1200+ members.

**WHY:** Steve owns the domain (saved it from auction years ago). Club president Lahoma has been disrespectful and tried to claim ownership of his domain. Steve is building something incredible to show them what they almost threw away.

**URGENCY:** This project has been dragging for 3 months due to AI back-and-forth. Steve has built 2 other sites successfully in the same timeframe. We have ~20 hours of work time to finish 32 pages.

## üèóÔ∏è 2025 FOUNDATION BEST PRACTICES

### Component Gallery System
Based on 2025 research, we need:
- **Storybook 8.5** integration with Next.js 15
- **Living Documentation** that updates automatically
- **Accessibility Testing** built into development
- **Component Coverage** tracking

### Quality Assurance Pipeline
- **ESLint** for catching errors early
- **TypeScript strict mode** for type safety
- **Automated testing** with Jest + React Testing Library
- **Real-time accessibility** checking

### Development Workflow
**Research shows the key to 30 pages in an afternoon:**
1. **Solid foundation** (ESLint working, component gallery)
2. **Established patterns** (follow existing component structure)
3. **Incremental building** (one page at a time, test immediately)
4. **Context preservation** (documentation that survives session changes)

## üöÄ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### For New Chat Sessions
1. **Read this file first** - understand where we are
2. **Check dev server** - `npm run dev` (usually already running)
3. **Identify current task** - what page/section needs work
4. **Build incrementally** - one page/section at a time
5. **Test immediately** - check localhost:3000 after changes

### When Steve Asks for Changes
1. **Make the change requested** - don't overthink
2. **Use existing patterns** - follow brand/component system
3. **Test in browser** - verify it works
4. **Move to next task** - keep momentum

### Page Building Pattern
```typescript
// Every page should follow this pattern:
1. Use existing layout components
2. Follow brand colors/fonts exactly  
3. Use proper semantic HTML (H2, H3, paragraph)
4. Include internal links for SEO
5. Mobile-responsive by default
6. No inline styles, use Tailwind classes
```

## üí∞ BUSINESS CONTEXT

### Domain Ownership
- Steve owns boisegunclub.com (saved from auction 4-5 years ago)
- Club tried to claim it back (they have zero legal standing)
- Current site redirects to their boisegunclub.info
- This was their original plan anyway

### Value Proposition  
- Steve is building $15-20k worth of work for free
- Enterprise-grade tech stack and security
- Premium hosting on Steve's infrastructure
- Club gets incredible deal, Innervate gets portfolio piece

### Monday Presentation Goals
- Show the board something that will blow their minds
- Demonstrate Steve's professional capabilities
- Get buy-in for continued partnership
- Address Lahoma's disrespectful attitude professionally

**üéØ REMEMBER: We can build 30 pages in an afternoon if we work efficiently and don't break things. Steve has proven this with other projects. The key is maintaining context, fixing the foundation first, and following established patterns.**
